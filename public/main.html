                  <p class ="card-text">Contact tracing is a key strategy for preventing further spread of COVID-19. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, contact tracing is a means of a core disease control measure that has been implemented by state and local health departments. Contact tracing can mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Public health officials work with patients who have tested or suspected confirmed infections. These patients are asked to recall everyone they have been in contact with, which then public health staff reaches out to those contacts to inform them they may have been exposed. The contacts are educated and informed how to separate themselves from others so they do not spread the infection. During times like this, it is important that we practice social distancing and do the best we can to prevent the further spread of COVID-19.</p>
